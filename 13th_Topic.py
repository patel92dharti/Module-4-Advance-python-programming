#Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?
"""
Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs.
Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing, and without this process,
exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program.

"""
The most common reason of an error in a Python program is when a certain statement is not in accordance with the prescribed usage. 
Such an error is called a syntax error. 
The Python interpreter immediately reports it, usually along with the reason. Example: Error.
